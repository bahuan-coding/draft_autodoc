Autodoc is an Ambar company with over 20 years in the market."

        "answer": "Autodoc Projects is a CDE (Common Data Environment) for managing architectural, structural, hydraulic, and electrical projects, with revision control, approval workflows, and automatic distribution. Autodoc Workforce focuses on supplier and jobsite management: onboarding, document validation (company registration, tax clearances, health certificates, safety certifications, PPE), biometric access control, and labor compliance. Together, they cover the entire construction cycle."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are GD4 Agents and what documents do they validate?",
        "answer": "GD4 Agents are 21 AI systems specialized in automatic document validation. They cover 4 categories: Company (registration, federal tax clearance, FGTS compliance, labor clearance, articles of incorporation), Worker (health certificate, NR-18, NR-35, NR-10, NR-33, PPE record), Technical (technical registration ART/RRT, construction permit, environmental license), and Fiscal (payroll report, social security, invoices, withholdings). Each agent extracts data, validates compliance, and generates an automatic report."
      },
      {
        "question": "Which construction companies use Autodoc?",
        "answer": "Autodoc is used by over 3,500 companies, including 60 of the top 100 construction companies in Brazil — MRV, Direcional, Tenda, Cury, Cyrela, Even, and Patrimar, among others. There are over 195,000 active users on the platform."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is Autodoc compatible with BIM?",
        "answer": "Yes. Autodoc Projects features an integrated BIM viewer, compatible with leading modeling software (Revit, ArchiCAD, Tekla). You can upload IFC models, view them on the platform, and link them to corresponding projects and documents."
      },
      {
        "question": "How long does implementation take?",
        "answer": "Implementation is quick and guided. Our Customer Success team handles onboarding, data migration, and training. Most clients are operational in under 2 weeks. For larger operations (100+ projects), the typical timeline is 4-6 weeks with dedicated support."
